This repository contains R code, results, and figures for the study: [**"MM Kling and DD Ackerly (2020). Global wind patterns and the vulnerability of wind-dispersed species to climate change. Nature Climate Change 10 (868-875)."**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0848-3)

The project also relied heavily on the [windscape](https://github.com/matthewkling/windscape) R package, developed in tandem with the code in this repository.
