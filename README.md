# Winds of change

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/267161663.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/267161663)

This repository contains R code, results, and figures for the study: **"MM Kling and DD Ackerly (2020). Global wind patterns and the vulnerability of wind-dispersed species to climate change. Nature Climate Change, in press."**

The project also relied heavily on the [windscape](https://github.com/matthewkling/windscape) R package, developed in tandem with the code in this repository.

Note that this is a fork of the [tailwinds](https://github.com/matthewkling/tailwinds) repository, with extraneous exploratory code and results cleaned up for release and deposition on Zenodo.
