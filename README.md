# Winds of change

This repository contains the code and results for the study: **"MM Kling and DD Ackerly (2020). Global wind patterns and the vulnerability of wind-dispersed species to climate change. Nature Climate Change, in press."**

The project also relied heavily on the [windscape](https://github.com/matthewkling/windscape) R package, developed in tandem with the code in this repository. 

Note that this is a fork of the [tailwinds](https://github.com/matthewkling/tailwinds) repository, with extraneous exploratory code and results cleaned up for release and deposition on Zenodo.
